NSW police are responding, they are being strongly supported by Commonwealth agencies. We don't yet know the motivation of the perpetrator, we don't know whether this is politically motivated although obviously there are some indications that it could be. We have to appreciate that even in a society such as ours, there are people who would wish to do us harm, that's why we have police and security organisations of the utmost professionalism that are ready and able to respond to a whole range of situations and contingencies including this situation that we are now seeing in Sydney. The whole point of politically motivated violence is to scare people out of being themselves. Australia is a peaceful, open, and generous society. Nothing should ever change that and that's why I would urge all Australians today to go about their business as usual. Of course, if anyone does have any suspicions of untoward activity, there is the national security hotline, 1800 123 400 which I would urge them to call. I can let you know that the national security committee of the Cabinet has been briefed on this incident. I've been in regular contact with Premier Baird over the course of the last couple of hours. I've been briefed by Commissioner Scipione of the NSW police and by Commissioner Colvin, of the Federal police. This is an unfolding situation and as the situation unfolds there will be operational updates provided by the NSW police. I want to assure people that the ordinary business of Government must go on and it will go on and that's why Treasurer Hockey and Finance Minister Mathias Cormann will shortly be released the MYEFO as planned. Finally, this is a very disturbing incident. I can understand the concerns and anxieties of the Australian people at a time like this, but our thoughts and prayers must above all go out to the individuals who are caught up in this. I can think of almost nothing more distressing, more terrifying than to be caught up in such a situation and our hearts go out to these people. I'm going to leave it to the NSW police who are in operational charge of this incident to provide those kinds of details. Obviously in a situation like this, all sorts of reports fly around, all sorts of claims are made, so I do urge everyone to exercise caution in their reporting, but I leave all of the operational details to the NSW police who as I understand it will begin providing operational updates shortly.\"\nIs this tweet fake news?
