The incident happened on Wednesday morning local time. Witnesses said they heard several shots near the memorial, close to the Canadian parliament. A soldier standing guard at the memorial was killed. The gunman then entered the nearby parliament buildings where more shots were fired. A female police officer was also injured in the attack. The gunman, who was later named as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was shot dead by a sergeant-at-arms inside the parliament building. He had previously been known to authorities for minor crimes but not as a terrorism suspect. The area around parliament hill is currently on lockdown with roads closed off and people told to stay indoors. This is the first time such an incident has occurred at the heart of Canada's government. Prime Minister Stephen Harper was in the parliament buildings at the time of the shooting but was unharmed. He later tweeted that Canada \"will never be intimidated\" by such attacks. The incident has raised questions about security at one of Canada's most sensitive locations. Parliament Hill is usually very well guarded with metal detectors and bag searches for visitors. However, it appears the gunman was able to get past these measures. The motive behind the attack is not yet clear but some reports suggest the gunman may have been acting out of sympathy for Islamic State militants. Canadian officials have warned of the threat posed by so-called \"lone wolf\" attackers inspired by extremist groups. This incident will likely increase concerns about such threats in Canada and elsewhere.\nIs this tweet fake news?

A group of religious leaders from different faiths gathered in Sydney's west on Sunday to show their solidarity with the Muslim community and denounce acts of vandalism at two mosques. The rally was organised in response to attacks on the Lakemba Mosque and the Hurlstone Park Islamic Centre earlier this month. Among those who spoke were Father Frank Brennan, Rabbi Jeremy Wiederhorn and Sheikh Mohammad Tawhidi. They condemned the vandalism and called for an end to religious intolerance. \"We are here today to say that we will not be divided,\" Father Brennan said. \"We will stand together against hatred and violence.\" Rabbi Wiederhorn said the Jewish community stood in solidarity with Muslims. \"We know what it's like to be persecuted,\" he said. \"We know what it's like to have our places of worship desecrated.\" Sheikh Tawhidi said the event showed that people of different faiths could live together in harmony. \"This is a message to the world that we can coexist,\" he said. \"We can respect each other and love each other.\" The rally was attended by about 50 people, including members of the Christian, Jewish and Muslim communities.\nIs this tweet fake news?
